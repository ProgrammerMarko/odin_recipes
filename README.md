# Odin Recipes

A simple multi-page recipe website built as part of [The Odin Project – Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). This project demonstrates the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, focusing on structure, navigation, and basic styling - forming the foundation for more complex web development projects. **Page is not mobile/tablet responsive. How to handle different screen sizes will be covered later in the curriculum!**

## Technologies used:

- HTML5

- [CSS3](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-block-and-inline#assignment)

- Git & GitHub for version control

- GitHub Pages for deployment
